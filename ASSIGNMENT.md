Build a proof of concept web application where:

- The user can view nearby doctors
- The user can book\* an appointment at one of the nearby doctors
- The user receives a confirmation email that the appointment has been accepted

\* Booking the appointment will involve accepting the user&#39;s name, email address and preferred appointment time. This information should then be relayed back to the user in a confirmation email. There is no need to store the appointment anywhere. We can assume that the integration with a booking system will be implemented in the future.

- Use Javascript (or Typescript) on the front-end, and any required technology on the backend.
- Add the source code to Github and provide instructions on how to access or run the application.
- Spend a maximum of 5 hours on this. Detailing any omissions of functionality.
